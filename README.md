# SpinDoc

In the early 90s, Callisto released a game for Macintosh operating systems called
Spin Doctor. I thought it was pretty neat. I wanted to start a project where I could
explore creating a game using Javascript drawing to a Canvas element, because I
wanted to learn about animating and operating on Canvas.

This is in very early stages and there is still a lot to do. It does not work yet.
